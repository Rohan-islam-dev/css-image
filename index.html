        <h3>  A Strong Headline</h3>
        <p>General titles are easy to <strong style="color: black ; text-decoration: underline;">forget</strong> . Specific ones grab attention. Instead of saying “Tips for Startups,” try something like “How This Startup Turned $1.5M in Burn Into Profit in 7 Months.” That’s the kind of headline that makes people want to click and read more.</p>

        <h3> Reader-Centered Framing</h3>
        <p>Your reader isn’t here to be impressed by how smart you are. They are looking for answers, help, or something interesting. Focus on what they need, not just what you want to say. When you think about their questions or problems, your writing becomes more helpful and easier to connect with.</p>
